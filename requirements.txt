Computer Graphics Lab Requirements
graphics.h Configuration (Code::Blocks)
============================================

1. Software Requirements
   - Operating System: Windows 10 / 11
   - IDE: Code::Blocks (with MinGW compiler included)
   - Compiler: GCC (MinGW, 32-bit recommended)

2. Configuration Files (Provided in config/ folder)
   The following files must be available inside the config/ directory:

   config/graphics.h
   config/winbgim.h
   config/libbgi.a

3. File Placement Instructions
   - Copy config/graphics.h to:
     CodeBlocks/MinGW/include/

   - Copy config/winbgim.h to:
     CodeBlocks/MinGW/include/

   - Copy config/libbgi.a to:
     CodeBlocks/MinGW/lib/

4. Linker Configuration (Code::Blocks)
   Open Code::Blocks and configure the linker as follows:

   Settings → Compiler → Linker Settings

   - Add the library file:
     libbgi.a

   - Add the following linker options exactly:
     -lbgi
     -lgdi32
     -lcomdlg32
     -luuid
     -loleaut32
     -lole32

5. Source File Requirements
   - Graphics programs must be written in C++
   - File extension must be .cpp
   - graphics.h must be included using:
     #include <graphics.h>

6. Build and Execution
   - Use "Build and Run" from Code::Blocks
   - Successful execution should open a graphics window

7. Notes
   - graphics.h is not a pip-installable package
   - Manual configuration using the provided config/ files is mandatory
   - 64-bit MinGW may cause linking errors; 32-bit MinGW is recommended

Computer Graphics Lab Requirements
graphics.h Configuration using TDM-GCC 32-bit
=====================================================

1. Software Requirements
   - Operating System: Windows 10 / Windows 11
   - Compiler: TDM-GCC 32-bit
   - GCC Version: Compatible 32-bit (TDM-GCC)
   - IDE (Optional): Code::Blocks or any GCC-supported editor
   - https://jmeubank.github.io/tdm-gcc/

2. Configuration Files (Provided in config/ folder)
   The following files must be present inside the config/ directory:

   config/graphics.h
   config/winbgim.h
   config/libbgi.a

3. File Placement Instructions (TDM-GCC)
   - Copy the following header files:
     config/graphics.h
     config/winbgim.h
     To:
     TDM-GCC/include/

   - Copy the library file:
     config/libbgi.a
     To:
     TDM-GCC/lib/

4. Compiler and Linker Configuration
   When compiling graphics programs using TDM-GCC, the following
   libraries must be linked in the given order:

   -lbgi
   -lgdi32
   -lcomdlg32
   -luuid
   -loleaut32
   -lole32

5. Source File Requirements
   - Programs must be written in C++
   - Source file extension must be .cpp
   - The graphics library must be included using:
     #include <graphics.h>

6. Compilation Command (Manual Build)
   Use the following command to compile a graphics program:

   g++ main.cpp -o main -lbgi -lgdi32 -lcomdlg32 -luuid -loleaut32 -lole32

7. Execution
   - Run the generated executable from Command Prompt or IDE
   - A graphics window indicates successful configuration

8. Notes and Constraints
   - TDM-GCC must be 32-bit; 64-bit compilers are not supported
   - graphics.h is not installable via package managers
   - Manual configuration using config/ files is mandatory
